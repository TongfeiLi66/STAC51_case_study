Research on factors that affect probability of having brown fats

We are no strangers to fat, but brown fat initially, research thought that brown fat was only found in newborns; 
however, with the advancement of technology, brown fat has gradually been found in adults. 
The function of brown fat is to allow mammals to adapt to cold environments, and this fat is activated only at low temperatures. 
The factors that determine the presence and volume of brown fat in adults are still to be studied, 
so the main objective of this study is to examine the relationship between numerous factors and the presence of brown fat in a large number of cancer patients.
